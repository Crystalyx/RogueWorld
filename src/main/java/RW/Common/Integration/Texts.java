			+ "Already know that part, and have a few equipped already. Some interesting effects, but a few I can't really use to the full potential yet.(Like those having to do with The First World, and ember.) I think currently I have the amulet for wind relations, the belt for ember drops(Stock piling the stuff. I have gone in Semi-Blind to this mod and the later stages so I know little of anything post void tier. Currently at the Engineering stage, making machines and about to start on Crystals.) The rings were a pair that effected the amount of MRUMU I received from mobs that I was using early on to help progress(thanks to Difficult life, I was making a ton of power off a single kill, and these rings only further buffed the amount), but I am considering swapping them out for something more useful now that I have a MRUCU containment chamber and a heat generator."
			+ "Current goals are to build a Chicken machine to farm Heart Containers off of, research things from Essential Thaumaturgy, and setting up Mithrium furnace in the End(Killed the Dragon within five hours of starting the world. It was only going to be harder the longer I waited, and I got fourteen hearts off his death) so I can finally start putting the nine or so stacks of the stuff to good use.(I'm taxed on iron and gold, only having one to two stacks of each. Why I was looking into the Magical Quarry and Magmatic Smeltery. Using this stuff instead will be a great ease on my demand of materials, for now at least.).";
